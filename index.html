<!--
  This is starter 'three.js' template.
  https://threejs-slack.herokuapp.com

  You can use it as an starter point and visualize
  some of your problems with understanding 'three.js',
  so people on 'Slack' or 'Stack Overflow' would be able
  to help you in a more productive way.

  Usage:
  Press the 'Fork' button on the top menu and then apply
  your changes to the index.js file.

  Note:
  Due to https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9562,
  we can't import files from 'three/examples/js', e.g.
  all external files like loaders or controls are not
  available in this case.

  Most of the common externals are already ported by
  community and available to install from 'npm'.

  If your example relies on some of the external files,
  you can click 'File editor' on the left menu, open
  'Dependencies' dropdown and then search and install
  required modules with 'Add dependency' button.
